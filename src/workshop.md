### Overview

The MFEM team is happy to invite you to the 2024 MFEM Community Workshop, which
will take place on October 22-24, 2024 in a hybrid format: in-person at
[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](#about-livermore-and-llnl) + virtually on Zoom.
The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration among all MFEM users and
developers, share the latest MFEM features with the broader community, deepen
application engagements, and solicit feedback to guide future development
directions for the project.


*We encourage you to join us in person if you can!*

### Simulation and Visualization Contest

We will be holding a simulation and visualization contest open to all attendees.
Participants can submit visualizations (images or videos) from MFEM-related
simulations. The winner of the competition (selected by the organizing
committee) will receive an MFEM T-shirt. We will also feature the images in the
[gallery](gallery.md). Here are the winners from the 2023 workshop:
